## Basic Terminology

* **filesystem-** The way files are created and organized

* **current directory-** The directory you are at in the moment

* **parent directory-** A particular directory in which you can move forward to a subdirectory or backwards to a previous directory

* **the difference between *your* home directory and *the* home directory-** *Your* home directory refers to your user's home directory while *the* home directory refers to the home directory located in the root. 

* **pathname-** The indication of the location of a file in the filesystem

* **relative path-** The location of a file starting from the current directory or a directory that is located inside the current directory

* **absolute path-** The location of a file starting at the root of the file system
